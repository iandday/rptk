Registry Persistence Toolkit (RPTK)

The Registry Persistence Toolkit (RPTK) is a Python-based framework that can be leveraged by forensic analysts, incident responders, and threat hunting teams to automate the process of parsing and analyzing persistence registry keys and their associated values.  Furthermore, the framework includes built-in functionality to leverage registry key whitelisting, intelligence (i.e. indicators of compromise (IOCs)), and Base64 encoding identification and decoding.

RTPK requires the installation of Will Ballenthin's python-registry module.  Download the module from Will's github page: https://github.com/williballenthin/python-registry
